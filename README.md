# amycorvidae.github.io

Welcome to my corner of the internet! This is where I pretend to be a professional while secretly wondering if anyone actually reads READMEs.

## What's This?

It's my personal site built with Jekyll, because apparently in 2025 we're still writing static sites and loving it. No databases, no drama, just good old HTML/CSS with some Ruby magic sprinkled on top.

## Running Locally

Want to see this masterpiece before it hits the internet? Easy:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:4000` and prepare to be... adequately impressed.

## The Tech Stack (aka Things I Googled)

- Jekyll (because Hugo seemed too hipster)
- GitHub Pages (free hosting? yes please)
- Sass (making CSS slightly less painful since 2006)
- Font Awesome (for icons that look way better than anything I could design)

## Contributing

Found a typo? A bug? Want to roast my code? Feel free to open an issue or PR. I promise I won't take it personally. (I might cry a little, but you won't see it.)

## License

This is my personal site, but if you find something useful in here, go wild. Just maybe don't copy my embarrassing commit messages.
